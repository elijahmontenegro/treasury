# Approach

## The problem as decoding

An application states what a label must say. The label image is that message received over a noisy channel: an unknown typeface at unknown sizes, lighting, angle, blur, and compression. Verification asks, for each expected value, whether the image contains a region whose code lies within a Hamming ball around a codeword for that value. Text is never the unit; bit codes are.

The codebook does not come from a font library. It comes from the image. Every compliant label carries the statutory government warning, about sixty words of known, verbatim text in the label's own type. Aligning that block to the known string teaches the engine the label's alphabet: this shape is an "e" in this face, weight, and lighting. Every other field is read with that alphabet. Only glyphs the warning lacks, digits and most capitals, are synthesized, in the bundled faces nearest the learned letterforms, and even those are replaced by the label's own glyphs once a claim that contains them has verified.

Nothing in the core knows what a label is. The engine takes a reference (text known to be printed, with spans expected in a heavier weight) and claims (expected text, or an enumeration of the values a field may take). The TTB case is a thin configuration: the reference is 27 CFR 16.21, the emphasis span is "GOVERNMENT WARNING:", the claims are brand, class, producer, origin, alcohol content, and net contents. A random photo of anything containing a known string goes through the same path.

## Pipeline

1. **Preprocess.** Grayscale, longer side to 1600 px, Sauvola threshold (window 31, k 0.2), deskew by projection-profile sweep, glare mask when the brightest percentile stands clear of the paper.
2. **Regions.** Connected components with dots folded into the glyph beneath; lines by vertical centre; regions are lines, bands, and every run of up to five words, so a value inside a sentence has a region of its own.
3. **Alphabet.** The densest vertically adjacent block is aligned to the reference by dynamic programming over (glyph, character) with match, merge (two or three characters printed touching), split (two or three components for one character), insert, delete, and space steps. The first pass uses shape-class priors derived from the characters (tall, descending, small, width); later passes use the distance to each character's centroid. The band is five percent of the glyph count and widens when the path touches its edge. Output: glyph samples per character, header samples apart, centroids, within-character spread, per-row quality.
4. **Codewords.** A claim's text is spelled by placing the medoid sample of each character on a baseline at the label's own letter and word gaps; characters the reference lacks are synthesized in the bundled face nearest the learned letterforms, their strokes brought to the learned stroke width, with the next-nearest faces as alternatives. Free text is spelled in its casing, quote, and weight variants. Enumerations spell every value in every printed form.
5. **Decode.** Every structurally plausible (region, candidate) pair is scored by aligning the region's components to the candidate's glyph codes with the same DP, so a single differing digit counts. The nearest region reads as its nearest candidate; the competitor is the nearest candidate of a different value on the same region under the same geometry. A claim is decided when the decisive readings among the regions near the best agree.
6. **Verdicts.** VERIFIED, MISMATCH (observed value named), REVIEW (candidates named), NOT_FOUND, SKIPPED. Reference rows verify, review, or fail on their own alignment anomalies; the emphasis span is heavy or regular by comparing it to itself at the body's stroke width and at 1.25 times it. Every verdict carries the region, distances, radius, what was synthesized, and the deskew angle.

## The glyph code

The spec's line hash (64×16 coverage plus a difference hash) is kept for regions without components and as evidence, but it does not decide anything. Measured against real lines it has a phase-noise floor near fifteen percent of its bits, larger than one differing digit, and as a ranker it put dozens of short spurious pairs ahead of the true one whenever the label's face differed from the synthesized one.

The code that decides is per glyph: a positional view of the glyph inside a frame of 2.2 x-heights (16×16 cells, so size and position above the baseline are part of the code) concatenated with a tight view of the ink's own box (12×16), both with coverage smoothed over neighbouring cells and quantized to four levels. The configuration was chosen by measurement (`internal/spell/frame_test.go`): across sizes the same character drifts by under a third of the distance between two different characters, the closest genuine pair stays 1.4 times the worst drift apart, and a four percent x-height or one pixel baseline error costs a fifth of a pair distance. Sharper grids and single views fail those tests.

This code is the error-correcting code of the channel in the sense the spec asks for: the alphabet's centroids are the codewords, the within-character spread is the noise, and the tie margin is set from that spread.

## Evaluation protocol

The synthetic set is drawn with faces the engine does not bundle. Labels drawn in the bundled faces would match synthesized digits by the same face that synthesized them; the evaluation refuses such a set unless told otherwise, and then stamps its table. The reported set uses the machine's installed faces: 26 families with both a regular and a bold, 117 text-capable faces for brand lines, including handwriting and decorative faces. Twenty percent of labels carry a deliberate error (wrong brand, wrong class, wrong alcohol content, wrong net contents, title-case header, regular-weight header, altered warning wording, a missing claim); eighty percent are pushed through the channel (rotation ±10°, perspective, blur σ ≤ 1.5, JPEG 40–95, brightness and contrast, glare). Thresholds are chosen on the even-numbered labels and reported on the odd-numbered ones.

### Results: 500 held-out labels, 2026-09-03

Generated with `gen set -n 500 -seed 1 -fontdir C:\Windows\Fonts` (26 body families with regular and bold, 117 text-capable faces; none bundled), evaluated with `eval -set synth -workers 10 -tune`. Latency is per label with ten labels in flight on one desktop CPU; a single verification takes about half that. Precision and recall are of VERIFIED against what was printed; "mismatch found" counts labels printed with a wrong value that were called MISMATCH; "not found on missing" counts claims left off the label that were called NOT_FOUND.

### Alphabet robustness, half B re-run, 2026-09-03

The dominant loss in the table above was labels that learned no alphabet: 27 percent, and every claim on them is NOT_FOUND. Tracing those labels found three causes, none of them the alignment itself. Blur fuses letters into words and the splitter measured its yardstick from the fused line, so it never cut. Light-gray text at gray 160 to 207 on a 245 background loses half its strokes to the threshold and shatters into fragments. And at x-heights of 10 to 14 pixels the shape-class tests sat on pixel boundaries: a 3 px descender is exactly a quarter x-height, a period is four to nine pixels of area against a floor of eight, and the alignment absorbed the dropped period into its neighbour as a merge that counted as a violation.

Three mechanisms answer them. Components are cut at necks, columns where the thickest ink is under three quarters of the stroke, and a component wide enough for three glyphs is also cut at single-run minima of its profile; the alignment's split path re-joins over-cuts and its merge path covers fusions the cutter misses. Thresholding is hysteretic: a permissive Sauvola pass is taken whole only for components where the strict pass found just the cores. Shape classes have dead bands, the width miss is uncapped, and the violation rate is per explained character. A wrong reference of the same length still scores 0.15 to 0.35 on that rate against 0.03 to 0.11 for real blocks.

Same 250 labels of half B, same protocol:

Reference rows: compliant labels with every row verified 82/208 (75 reviewed, 51 failed); wording and title-case errors caught 6/9.
Emphasis: correct on 144/198 labels (compliant headers verified and regular-weight headers caught).

Labels without an alphabet fell from 70 to 16 (6.4 percent). Among the 180 labels that already learned one, free-text recall is unchanged (0.915 against 0.92); the 54 newly recovered labels verify 30 percent of their free text, because their claim lines are as fused or as faint as their warnings were. Per-character acceptance produced two `char_unlearned` reviews in 250 labels. The alphabet gates on the sample hold at 99.2, 99.2, and 99.3 percent.

## What the numbers say

Precision of VERIFIED is the number that matters for a compliance tool, and it holds at 0.97 to 1.00 on every claim: the engine does not confirm a wrong value. Where it lacks evidence it says REVIEW or NOT_FOUND. The seven brand verdicts counted against precision are labels whose producer line names the applicant's company with the expected brand words ("Distilled and Bottled by Highland Gate Company" under a brand line reading something else); the engine found the brand text where it genuinely is. A caller that needs the brand on the brand line must say so; the engine verifies text, not layout.

Recall of free-text claims is about 0.70 over the whole set and about 0.95 among labels that learned an alphabet; the gap is the 27 percent of labels that did not. Those are labels blurred until letters fuse (a warning with 240 characters arriving as 70 to 90 components), rotated and compressed until the block does not align, or low in contrast under JPEG noise; they return NOT_FOUND on every claim rather than a guess. A printed class that differs from the application is NOT_FOUND rather than MISMATCH, because free text has no enumeration to name the other value against.

Alcohol content and net contents are decided by digits, and the reference teaches only 1 and 2. Digits synthesized from bundled faces separate a held-out font's digits poorly; alternatives from the three nearest faces and digits learned from claims that verified raise net recall to 0.59 and alcohol content to 0.33 on the reported half, and every wrong net-contents value that decoded at all was called MISMATCH. The remaining alcohol-content claims mostly stop at REVIEW with the two nearest values named, which is the honest outcome when a 7 and a 1 in an unfamiliar face sit within one alphabet spread of each other. This is where the spec's learned encoder belongs: a code trained to keep the same digit together across faces and channel would lift exactly these numbers.

The reference rows verify completely on 38 percent of compliant labels, review on 48, and fail on 14; half of the altered-wording and title-case errors are caught. The threshold sweep at the end of the table shows the trade: a lower failure threshold catches more altered wordings and fails more compliant labels, and no setting separates them well, because a blurred letter and a substituted one look alike to the code. The emphasis test is right on 70 percent of labels. Both would improve with the same encoder.

## Limits, stated

- A brand in a display face outside the alphabet decodes as NOT_FOUND.
- A label without a legible warning block yields no alphabet; every claim is NOT_FOUND with reason `no_alphabet`.
- Heavy blur that fuses letters, steep angles, and low contrast with compression noise degrade alignment; the engine says so rather than guessing.
- Digits are the least reliable glyphs because they are never in the reference; the learned encoder of the spec's stretch section is the remedy if the table below target is not enough.
- Unusual net-contents sizes outside the enumeration decode as REVIEW.
- One alignment slip and one substituted letter look the same; a reference row with a single anomaly goes to review with the glyph as evidence.
